# Artificial-Intelligence-CS-44201 Assignment 1 README

The instructions of the assignment state to have a README file to describe how to run the code.  However, Since I included the code as a Jupyter Notebook including explanations of my steps, I feel that most of the direction on how to run the code lies inside the notebook.  Simply running each portion of the code in order should produce the results for both search methods where it is indicated in the text (you may want to restart the kernel before running each code portion, but I don't believe it is necessary).
